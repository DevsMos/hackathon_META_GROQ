**Apoia.AI** is a social impact startup dedicated to providing a compassionate and innovative approach to financial recovery. Powered by LLaMa 3 and driven by the technology of **GROQ** and **CREWAI**, our platform offers a crowdfunding system that enables users in financial distress to receive anonymous support from friends and family. Donors have the freedom to choose how they can best assist in the beneficiary's journey to financial stability.

Through an easy-to-use WhatsApp interface, we deliver personalized financial education content tailored to users' spending habits and individual needs. Companies can partner with us by subscribing to access open finance data, with users maintaining full control over whether to share their financial information, ensuring transparency and empowerment.

Beyond financial education, Apoia.AI serves as a bridge to connect individuals with job opportunities, promoting both personal and professional growth in a way that upholds human dignity. We offer onboard programs for open finance, career development plans, and professional training in partnership with specialized schools, empowering our users to build a secure and sustainable financial future.

Our mission is to transform lives by providing the tools and support needed for genuine financial recovery, generating positive and socially responsible impact within the community.
